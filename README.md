Part of a larger collection of a solution made for the stats, analysis and predictions for the Premier league season 2019-2020. 
This is chunk of code is used for remote functions, that internally collect and arrange the data of 20 premier league teams internally and externally provide remote functions to allow fast return of this data that can be used by any REST web app. The data returned is in form of JSON.

### Prerequisites
REST web app with hosted on a server that can call remote functions from the firebase host. For the end users, they would also need to be experienced with noSQL data handling.
